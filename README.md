# Trilateration Using Leaflet and Turf.js

This repository contains a simple HTML-based trilateration script that demonstrates the concept of trilateration using Leaflet and Turf.js libraries. Trilateration is a technique used to determine an unknown position using the distances between that position and known locations.

## Task
The repository demonstrates an interactive map-based approach to trilateration. Three circles representing known locations and their respective distances are drawn on the map. Upon running the script, the user's approximate location based on the intersection of these circles is calculated and displayed on the map.

## How to Run
To run the script, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports JavaScript. Follow the instructions provided on the page to:

1. Draw three circles representing known locations and their distances.
2. Click the "Find My Location" button to calculate the approximate user location based on the intersection of these circles.
3. View the results displayed on the map.

## Libraries Used
The script utilizes the following libraries:
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/): An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/): A modular geospatial engine for JavaScript.
